Description: Custom gpg state, module and renderer.
 The custom state and module provides the ability to import or verify gpg keys,
 while the custom renderer will fail to render a .sls state file if the state
 file contains the #!verify shebang and the statefile fails verification do to
 any reason such as missing key, missing detached signature.
